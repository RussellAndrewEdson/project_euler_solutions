;; For this problem we want to find the maximum 16-digit string
;; solution to the 'magic 5-gon ring'. Denote the nodal numbers
;; of the 5-gon ring by a1, a2, ..., a10, e.g. pictorially:
;;
;;                        a1
;;                          \
;;                           a2     a4
;;                          /  \   /
;;                       a9      a3
;;                      / \      /
;;                   a10   a7 - a5 --- a6
;;                          \
;;                           a8
;;
;; Now since we are after 16-digit strings (and not 17-digit strings),
;; this means that the two-digit 10 number must appear on one of the
;; 'spokes' a1, a4, a6, a8 or a10. WLOG, suppose a10 = 10 (since we
;; can rotate the 5-gon until this is true).
;;
;; Then our string-form for 5-gon solutions looks like
;;    a1,a2,a3; a4,a3,a5; a6,a5,a7; a8,a7,a9; 10,a9,a2
;; (where we cycle through the triples until the smallest of a1, a4,
;; a6 and a8 appears at the front), and we find all a1,a2,...,a9
;; that satisfy the following linear equations:
;;   a1 + a2 + a3 = N
;;   a3 + a4 + a5 = N
;;   a5 + a6 + a7 = N
;;   a7 + a8 + a9 = N
;;   a2 + a9 + 10 = N
;; for some given line total N.

;; Now we need some bounds for N. Since 10 must appear in one of the
;; lines, and the digits are unique, then the smallest possible N
;; is exactly 1 + 2 + 10 = 13. By a similar (albeit lazy) reasoning,
;; the largest possible N is 8 + 9 + 10 = 27, although this N has
;; exactly zero solutions so a tighter upper bound is readily possible.

;; The crux of our program is therefore as follows: we'll loop for
;; N between 13 and 27 and loop for all permutations of a1,...,a9
;; in the digits 1-9, collecting up the solutions that we find.
;; Once the solutions have been found we'll reorganize them into
;; the normal form (with the smallest 'spoke' number appearing first
;; in the string), and then grab the maximum.

;; We first code a function to test for a solution:
(defun solution? (a n)
  "True if the list A = (a1 a2 ... a9) is a solution for total = N."
  (and
   (= n (+ (first a) (second a) (third a)))
   (= n (+ (third a) (fourth a) (fifth a)))
   (= n (+ (fifth a) (sixth a) (seventh a)))
   (= n (+ (seventh a) (eighth a) (ninth a)))
   (= n (+ (second a) (ninth a) 10))))

;; We'll bring in the cl-permutation library to handle the looping
;; across solutions (i.e. permutations of the digits 1 through 9),
;; and then simply collect up the solutions that we find.
